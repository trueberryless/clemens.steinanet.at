# Astro Portfolio Template @trueberryless

[![Built with Astro](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-astro/tiny.svg)](https://astro.build)

## Getting started

1. Use this template via the GitHub UI.
2. Clone your own repo and open it in any editor of your choice (global search recommended).
3. Search for `TODO` everywhere and complete them. Be aware: to fully complete these steps it will take you around one hour, so be patient, but I promise, it will be worth it ðŸ’œ
4. Deploy your website with Netlify, Vercel or in any other possible way, Astro supports: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/
